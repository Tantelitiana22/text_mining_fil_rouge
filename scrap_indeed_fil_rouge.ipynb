The institute aims to provide the highest level of care for all children with cancer and has the ambition to cure all children of cancer and significantly reduce unwanted side effects. The center brings together the best possible care and scientific research, creating a unique interdisciplinary institute for pediatric oncology in Europe.The research team led by Anne Rios, PhD has recently started to study the causes of childhood cancer and treatment-associated second malignancies via state-of-the-art-microscopy methods. By understanding the processes that cause cancers, effective preventive therapies can be developed, diagnostics improved and choice of treatment facilitated.To achieve these goals, we combine mouse genetics, developmental biology, and state-of the art microscopy. In our team, we value collegiality, enthusiasm, dedication, respect and reliability, which allow us to successfully reach our goals, while creating a stimulating working atmosphere.Our advanced microscopy methods generate large sets of 3D image data. However the handling, analysis and interpretation of this big imaging datasets is extremely complex and computational, bioinformatics and machine learning methods and tools are needed. For this aim we currently have an opening for a Computational scientist.Tasks and responsibilitiesYour role: Support the computational and image processing efforts of a dedicated team of scientists.You will be heading the computational efforts within the Rios group and collaborate with a strongly integrated team of computational experts from different groups within the institute, with connections to bioinformatics and computational groups within Utrecht. Your goal will be to exploit at maximum the information contained in large 3D imaging data sets. You will be given the opportunity to set up and drive your own research projects in the field of computational imaging and complex data analytics.\\n\\nSkills and educationWe are asking for: An independent and driven computational scientist to develop state of the art solutions for complex 3D imaging data processing, analysis and interpretation. The candidate should have an open and creative mind, strong analytical and computational skills. Experience if possible, in image or volume processing (e.g. pattern recognition, segmentation, non-rigid registration), algorithms development and implementation for imaging problems is desired.
